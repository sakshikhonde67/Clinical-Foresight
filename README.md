# Clinical-Foresight
This project is an AI tool that predicts hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients. It uses an interactive dashboard to not only show the risk level but also to clearly explain the specific factors that contribute to it, helping doctors make proactive care decisions.

# ü©∫ AI-Powered Diabetes Readmission Prediction

> This project develops an AI-powered predictive system designed to forecast the risk of hospital readmission for diabetic patients within 30 days of discharge. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive clinical dataset, the system not only predicts risk but also provides clear, interpretable explanations for its conclusions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The final solution is delivered as an interactive Streamlit dashboard, enabling clinicians to input patient data and receive an instant risk assessment and a breakdown of the contributing factors, facilitating proactive and data-driven patient care.

## üìã Project Overview

### The Problem üè•
Hospital readmissions are a major challenge in healthcare, leading to increased costs, strained resources, and often indicating a gap in patient care. For chronic conditions like diabetes, the risk of readmission is particularly high. A key difficulty for healthcare providers is accurately identifying which patients are most at risk before they leave the hospital, as the contributing factors can be numerous and complex.

### The Solution üí°
This project tackles the problem by building a robust, data-driven tool that provides two key functions: **prediction** and **explanation**.

* **Prediction:** At its core, the project uses a Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyze dozens of patient attributes‚Äîsuch as age, time in hospital, number of medications, and primary diagnosis‚Äîto calculate a precise probability of readmission.

* **Explanation (XAI):** Knowing the "what" (the risk score) is not enough; clinicians need to know the "why." Using the SHAP framework, the system makes the model's "thinking" transparent. It pinpoints exactly which factors are pushing a specific patient's risk up (e.g., "multiple prior inpatient visits") or pulling it down (e.g., "A1C test result is normal"), turning the black-box model into a trustworthy clinical decision-support tool.

### Technical Approach ‚öôÔ∏è
The project was executed in a systematic pipeline:

* **Data Foundation:** The `diabetic_data.csv` dataset was rigorously cleaned. This involved handling missing values, removing irrelevant identifiers, and simplifying complex features like medical diagnosis codes into broader, more meaningful categories.

* **Handling Imbalance:** A critical challenge was the severe class imbalance (far more patients are not readmitted than are). This was solved by implementing **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), which intelligently creates synthetic examples of at-risk patients in the training data, ensuring the model learns to recognize them effectively.

* **Deployment:** The final, trained model and its SHAP explainer were saved and integrated into a **Streamlit web application**. This dashboard provides an intuitive interface where users can input patient information and receive an immediate, actionable risk analysis.

## üîë Key Features

* **ü§ñ Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted within 30 days.
* **‚öñÔ∏è Class Balancing:** Implements the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address the severe class imbalance inherent in the dataset, leading to a more robust model.
* **üß† Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrates the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to explain both global feature importance and individual patient predictions.
* **üìë Automated PDF Reports:** Generates comprehensive PDF reports summarizing model performance, high-risk patient lists, and visual explanations.
* **üåê Interactive Dashboard:** Includes a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time risk assessment and decision support.
